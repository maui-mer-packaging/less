Description: |
    The less utility is a text file browser that resembles more, but has
    more capabilities.  Less allows you to move backwards in the file as
    well as forwards.  Since less doesn't have to read the entire input file
    before it starts, less starts up more quickly than text editors (for
    example, vi). 
    
    You should install less because it is a basic utility for viewing text
    files, and you'll use it frequently.
